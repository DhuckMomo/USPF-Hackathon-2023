# Training Model
## Train a machine learning model using historical data. Common models for predictive risk assessment include regression models, decision trees, or more advanced techniques like ensemble models or neural networks.
# Integration with Flask
## Integrate the trained model into your Flask application. When a user submits an incident report, use the predictive model to assess the potential risk level based on the reported incident details.
# Display Predictions
## Display the risk assessment predictions to users. This could be done by adding a section on the user interface that shows the predicted risk level for the reported incident.
